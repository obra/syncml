SyncML TODO

* Data::ICal
  * Make it understand the difference between vCal and iCal, esp. as regards QP and line
    folding

* SyncML / application API
  * Finish transitioning *all* of the methods (not just update_item) to use SyncML::APIReturn
    objects as return values.  (Possibly rewrite all methods to use keyword args too.)
  * Once it's more stable, doc the hell out of that interface.
  * Make sure the RT interface is solid.
  * Bring the YAML API up to date to using the same interface as the RT, so it can be used for testing.

* Engine
  * Make the engine use something more sane than a yaml file for the "sync DB".

* Testing
  * At the very least, have some "full-interaction" tests. (Will require the YAML interface to
    work again.)

* Packaging
  * Make the RT integration less ad-hoc.  (Probably, split it into a SyncML dist and an RT::SyncML dist...
    fortunately it's not like this requires splitting any files in half.)
  * User-level docs?
